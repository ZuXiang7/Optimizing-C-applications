This program is written using C++ and the goal is to attempt to
optimized converting directed graph to undirected graph 
represented by adjacency matrix.
This is done by using blocking method to optimize the 
cache usage.

The program displays the <number of dimensions> <cyles>.
It will perform the profiling for the basic function first,
followed by the optmized function.
